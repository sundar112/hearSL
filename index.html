                        <p>
                            In the past, individuals with hearing and speech impairments in Sri Lanka encountered significant challenges while trying to integrate into society. Due to their disabilities, they faced difficulties in communicating effectively with others. Their primary means of expressing their needs, emotions, and feelings to the world was through Sign Language. However, a significant barrier existed as most of society was unfamiliar with Sign Language. Consequently, those with disabilities had to rely on individuals proficient in Sign Language to facilitate communication with those who did not understand it. Without this intermediary, it was often challenging for ordinary individuals to comprehend what the disabled person was trying to convey.
                            <br /><br />
                            Moreover, while numerous applications and devices worldwide were available for translating Sign Language into English and other languages, there was a noticeable gap in the Sri Lankan context. Although there had been research efforts to create applications that could translate Sign Language into Sinhala, these applications had limitations. For instance, some could only convert one sign at a time into a single word or letter in Sinhala. There were no applications capable of translating entire sign language presentations into Sinhala through methods like video recording. Our project aimed to address this gap by developing an application with the ability to perform such translations.
                            <br /><br />
                            Another observation was that ordinary people had various means of communication through applications designed for speaking, listening, and visual interaction. However, individuals with hearing impairments, speech impairments, and visual impairments faced challenges in using these applications. To bridge this gap, we endeavored to create a specialized chat application that facilitated seamless communication between those with hearing and speech impairments and the general population. This chat application was complemented by our Sign Language to Sinhala language converter, making it an inclusive tool for all.

                            <strong>Prototype Machine Translation System From Text-To-Indian Sign Language (2008):</strong> In 2008, Tirthankar Dasgupta, Sandipan Dandpat, and Anupam Basu introduced a prototype machine translation system aimed at serving as a teaching and learning tool for Indian Sign Language. The system accepts simple English sentences as input and facilitates information retrieval. However, it lacks a sign synthesis module using animated avatars and detailed working descriptions.
                            <br /><br />
                            <strong>Sign Language to Speech Translation System Using PIC Microcontroller (2013):</strong> Gunasekaran K. and Manikandan R. developed a Sign Language to Speech Translation System in 2013, offering high dependability, rapid responsiveness, and precise hand movement. It is versatile, allowing the installation of different languages without altering the original code, but its main drawback is the increased manufacturing cost.
                            <br /><br />
                            <strong>Voice-Controlled Artificial Handspeak System (2014):</strong> In 2014, Jonathan Gatti, Carlo Fonda, Livio Tenze, and Enrique Canessa created a paper robotic hand prototype. Utilizing a low-cost 3D printer and open-source technology, the system is controlled by a voice recognition engine and Arduino UNO connected to a Raspberry Pi. The current iteration has some room for improvement.
                            <br /><br />
                            <strong>Translating Indian Sign Language to Text and Voice Messages (2015):</strong> "Translating Indian Sign Language to Text and Voice Messages" (2015) presents a system with portability and user independence, capable of interpreting sign language into text messages. It employs an energy-efficient microcontroller and a user-friendly smartphone application but comes with a higher cost.
                            <br /><br />
                            <strong>Intelligent Arabic Sign Language to Arabic Text Translation (2018):</strong> In 2018, A. E. E. El Alfi and S. M. EL Atawy introduced an intelligent Arabic Sign Language to Arabic text translation technology, supporting a mobile conversation app. While it effectively resolved language issues, it couldn't interpret text from Arabic into Arabic sign language and faced challenges in matching grammatical conventions.
                            <br /><br />
                            <strong>Voice to Sign Language Translation System for Malaysian Deaf People (2009):</strong> The 2009 paper "V2S: Voice to Sign Language Translation System for Malaysian Deaf People" by Oi Mean Foong, Tang Jung Low, and Wai Wan La discusses a system for Malaysian sign language. Its main advantage is voice support (English language), but it requires initial speech pattern training using spectral parameters.
                            <br /><br />
                            <strong>Android Application to Aid Uneducated Deaf-Dumb People (2014):</strong> Dalia Nashat, Abeer Shoker, Fowzyah Al-Swat, and Reem Al-Ebailan introduced an Android application in 2014 aimed at helping uneducated deaf and dumb individuals. It offers communication support, quizzes, games, and a sign language keyboard. However, it has limitations such as one sign per letter, Android OS support only, no face-to-face interaction, and a focus on teaching rather than practical use.
                            <br /><br />
                            <strong>Design and Implementation of a Sign Language Recognition System for Sinhala Language:</strong> H.M.D. Piumal and H.M.N. Dilum Bandara's work focuses on a sign language recognition system for Sinhala language. It employs sensor data and machine learning techniques like decision trees, naive bayes, and k-nearest neighbor algorithms to identify Sinhala sign language motions. The authors conducted tests using a specially designed sensor system to gather data from 10 Sinhala sign language motions.

                    <h1>Research Gap</h1>
                    <p>
                      In the past, it was a well-known fact that sign language devices existed for various languages, but most of these devices could only translate basic words and individual alphabet characters. Furthermore, these devices were in the early stages of development, which prompted us to embark on a mission to elevate them to an advanced level. While there were previous research efforts in Sri Lanka aimed at translating Sinhala sign language using specialized devices and cameras, they remained in their infancy, and their practical implementation was limited.
                        <br /><br />
                        In light of these challenges, we set out to create a smartphone application capable of translating complete sentences from sign language to Sinhala (Singlish). Our research aimed to bridge the gap between the hearing and speech impaired community and the wider Sri Lankan population. Unlike the general public, people with these disabilities faced issues when communicating using modern chat applications like WhatsApp. Our solution was a unique chat application, catering to the hearing, speech, and visually impaired individuals, facilitating communication through Sign Animations, Sign Emojis, Sinhala Text, and Sinhala Voice messages according to the user's specific disability.
                        <br /><br />
                        To enable voice-to-text and text-to-voice conversion in Sinhala, we incorporated Google text-to-speech and speech-to-text APIs. Additionally, we developed a specialized SAESV Converter (Sign Animation, Emoji to Sinhala Voice Converter) API, a groundbreaking tool for transforming Sign Language Animations and Emojis into Sinhala voice.
                        <br /><br />
                        To personalize the application for users based on their disability, we implemented a chatbot, which allowed users to specify their disability (blindness, speech impairment, or hearing impairment) and customized the application accordingly.
                        <br /><br />
                        Our research contributed to the development of a system capable of producing Sinhala sign language word-by-word, making it more comprehensible for the hearing-impaired. Unlike previous research in Sri Lanka, our system was unique in its approach, focusing on everyday words. Furthermore, users could input their ideas by voice or Sinhala typing, a feature previously unavailable for the Sinhala language.
                        <br /><br />
                        We believed that our application could significantly benefit the Sinhalese hearing-impaired community in Sri Lanka, bridging the gap between them and the wider population. This research marked the first attempt to create a comprehensive database of Sinhala sign language meanings in 'Singlish,' paving the way for more accessible communication.
                        <br /><br />
                        However, it's important to note that there were no existing applications, devices, or software in Sri Lanka capable of translating 'Singlish' sign language into the relevant Sinhala voice. This research filled that void, providing a unique solution. Users had the option to select the correct Sinhala word related to the sign shown by the system, adding a level of personalization to the translation process.
                        <br /><br />
                        Our research represented a significant step forward, aiming to improve the lives of hearing, speech, and visually impaired individuals in Sri Lanka and foster greater inclusivity and understanding among the community.

                        <h1>Problem Statement</h1>
                        <p>In 2012, the World Health Organization estimated that 7.5% of Sri Lanka's population has hearing loss, with additional percentages facing blindness and vision impairments. In 2023, these figures may have increased. Deaf and blind individuals in Sri Lanka encounter societal challenges due to a lack of awareness and resources for sign language. To address this, the author aims to develop a system that converts 'Singlish' sign language to Sinhala voice speech. The system's purpose is to facilitate communication and inclusion for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community in Sri Lanka. It addresses barriers in education, employment, and social interaction, aiming to reduce stigma and improve social inclusion. The article also highlights the need for technology solutions to bridge the communication gap and improve accessibility for the deaf and mute community. This research emphasizes the importance of culturally sensitive technology solutions to promote social equity and inclusion.</p>

                        <h1>Solution</h1>
                        <p>Special Sign Emojis and Animations: The chat application will feature a unique set of sign Emojis and animations specially designed to facilitate communication for the deaf and mute community. Users, including the general population, can employ these symbols to chat and express themselves effectively.</p>
                        <p>Sinhala Voice Capture and Conversion: The solution will incorporate an inbuilt feature for Sinhala voice capture and conversion. This technology will enable users to transform spoken Sinhala into sign Emojis or animations, enhancing communication with those who rely on sign language for expression.</p>
                        <p>Sign Detection System with Singlish Conversion: Additionally, a system with advanced computer vision capabilities will be implemented. This system can detect signs presented to a camera and accurately decipher the meaning of those signs. It will then convert the detected meaning into 'Singlish,' which represents the Sinhala meaning of the sign. This feature will significantly benefit the deaf and mute community in their interactions with others.</p>
